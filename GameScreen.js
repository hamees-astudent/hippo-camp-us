/**
 * GameScreen
 *
 * A responsive memory-match game screen built with React Native.
 *
 * Behavior:
 * - Initializes a deck with an even number of positions (totalCards), populated by randomly chosen pairs from a global cards array.
 * - Reveals all cards briefly at the start of each round or when difficulty increases.
 * - Allows revealing up to two cards; evaluates a match after a short delay.
 * - Marks matched pairs with a negative sentinel (-1) and disables interaction for them.
 * - When all positions are matched, automatically increases difficulty by adding 2 more cards.
 *
 * Timing:
 * - Initial reveal duration is (totalCards / 2) * 1000 ms.
 * - Match evaluation delay is 1000 ms.
 *
 * Layout:
 * - Computes a near-square grid: columns = ceil(sqrt(number of cards)).
 * - Each card cell width is 100 / columns percent, with spacing between cells.
 *
 * State:
 * - totalCards: even integer >= 2 that controls the number of card positions.
 * - revealedCards: number[] of currently revealed card indices (0â€“2 items).
 * - pickedCards: number[] where positive values reference entries in the global cards array; matched positions are set to -1.
 *
 * Side effects:
 * - On totalCards change: generates a new randomized list of cards and reveals all indices.
 * - On revealedCards change: hides any revealed cards after the computed initial reveal duration.
 * - When exactly two cards are revealed: checks for a match; if matched, marks them with -1, clears the reveal buffer, and if all are matched, increases totalCards by 2.
 *
 * External requirements:
 * - cards: array holding available card identifiers/images.
 * - generateRandomList(count, min, max): returns a list of integer indices to sample from the cards array.
 * - Card component props: { card: number, index: number, revealCard: () => void, isRevealed: boolean }.
 *
 * Interaction rules:
 * - Matched positions are not rendered and have pointer events disabled.
 * - A card cannot be revealed if already revealed, already matched, or if two cards are currently revealed.
 *
 * @returns {JSX.Element} A React Native ImageBackground containing a responsive grid of memory cards.
